  HtmlToPdf [GLOBAL OPTION]... [OBJECT]... <output file>
  
Document objects:
  HtmlToPdf is able to put several objects into the output file, an object is
  either a single webpage, a cover webpage or a table of contents.  The objects
  are put into the output document in the order they are specified on the
  command line, options can be specified on a per object basis or in the global
  options area. Options from the Global Options section can only be placed in
  the global options area.

  A page objects puts the content of a single webpage into the output document.

  (page)? <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...
  Options for the page object can be placed in the global options and the page
  options areas. The applicable options can be found in the Page Options and 
  Headers And Footer Options sections.

  A cover objects puts the content of a single webpage into the output document,
  the page does not appear in the table of contents, and does not have headers
  and footers.

  cover <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for
  a cover.

  A table of contents object inserts a table of contents into the output
  document.

  toc [TOC OPTION]...
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for
  a toc, further more the options from the TOC Options section can also be
  applied. The table of contents is generated via XSLT which means that it can
  be styled to look however you want it to look. To get an idea of how to do
  this you can dump the default xslt document by supplying the
  --dump-default-toc-xsl, and the outline it works on by supplying
  --dump-outline, see the Outline Options section.
